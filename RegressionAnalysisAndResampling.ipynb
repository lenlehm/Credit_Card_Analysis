    "Name: Lennart Lehmann (ERASMUS Student)\n",

    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we parameterize digital terrain data by using three different regression algorithms: <br /> \n",
    "**1.) Linear Regression / Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** <br />\n",
    "**2.) Ridge Regression** <br />\n",
    "**3.) Lasso Regression** <br />\n",
    "Utilizing Cross-Validation as resampling technique to judge the bias and variance of the different models. <br /> \n",
    "We find that the OLS method scores the best for our underlying data, followed by the Lasso Regression and ending up last with the Ridge Regression.\n",
    "Displaying the bias-variance tradeoff reveals that we our model is mostly dominated in the bias area and the variance basically no effect on the mean error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression methods are fundamental in the field of statistical modelling. In the simplest\n",
    "variant of regression analysis modelling a response dependent on some predictor variables\n",
    "a linear ansatz is assumed for the relasionship between response and predictors. The\n",
    "ansatz is linear in the sense of a linear combination of (possibly non-linear) functions of a single\n",
    "predictor. This linearity allows the matrix-vector equations resulting from minimizing the\n",
    "error between the observed data (targets) and the predicted model data to be solved, which\n",
    "is the main advantage of the method (and the main reason why linear regression is extensively\n",
    "used today). In the modern society, data is ubiquitous and abundant. However, with an ever increasing volume\n",
    "of data availability, drawing sensible conclusions about the relasionships between variables\n",
    "is non-trivial. Suppose you were given a complete set of statistics about every school\n",
    "district in Norway: The grade point average (and indeed individual grades) of every single\n",
    "student, the size and composition (in terms of nationalities, gender, height, weight, etc.) of every\n",
    "class, a full description of the teaching load of every teacher, as well as their personal data,\n",
    "educational history, and work history. Such a data set might be readily available, but drawing\n",
    "conclusions from it is not easy. Say e.g. that you wanted to know if increasing the number of\n",
    "teachers per pupil would result in overall better grades. Or a more complex question what\n",
    "is the most efficient way to increase the overall grades of students?\n",
    "Such questions pertaining to relationships between data of varying types are possible to answer\n",
    "using regression analysis, and bound on the statistical significance of the answers are possible\n",
    "to find. In the following, we will consider a much simpler toy problem as a simple introduction\n",
    "to the topic: Fitting a real valued function of two real variables. We will start out by considering\n",
    "the theory behind linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset included 102.234 transactions for each single feature. So we have an overall Matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ of the shape $ X \\in {\\rm I\\!R^{n\\times p}}$ <br /> \n",

    "### Resampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling methods are crucial in Machine learning, especially when dealing with limited amount of data. <br />\n",
    "The main idea behind resampling is to repeatedly draw (different) samples from the dataset and split those accrodingly into test - and training data. Every single run a model gets fitted on the training data set and eventually evaluated with its test dataset. The final output will then be the average of the testing accuracy of all performed runs. <br />\n",
    "However, this nice feature comes to the cost of computation. Since models have to be fitted every single time and evaluated on different subsets of the data, resampling methods such as *k-fold Cross Validation* or *Bootstrapping* are computationally\n",
    "expensive. <br />\n",
    "*Bootstrapping* is a statistical technique for estimating quantities about a population by taking averages over estimates from several smaller data samples. <br />\n",
    "Those samples are constructed by drawing random observations from a large data sample (usually the training set in Machine Learning) with replacement. <br />\n",
    "By taking repeatedly small samples of a population, the bootstrap resampling method calculates the statistics (Mean Squarred Error (MSE), bias, variance) of those samples. This will result in an indication of the appropriate order of model complexity. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross- Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation is used to split the entire data into 2 groups, calles *training* and *test data*. A model's performance is always evaluated on the *test data* by calculating the accuracy metrics on this data set with the given targets and model's predictions. <br />\n",
    "By splitting the entire data into *k-even subsets* (where $k \\in [1, 2, ..., n]$), we obtain a training dataset of size *k-1* subsets and one subset of test data. This technique is calles *k-fold Cross Validation*. <br /> \n",
    "Afterwards each single subset will be once used as test data which will in turn lead to *k* runs of the exact same model (same hyperparameters) but different training and test data for each run. Hence, each run returns a test error on its underlying test data. By averaging the test errors by the *k* number of runs, we obtain the final model accuracy.<br /> \n",
    "Thus, *Cross-Validation* is used to asses the performance of a given model. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terrain Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We were given a dataset containing an area of Tinn, Norway with its land surface topology and a resolution of roughly 30m (1 arc-second).  <br> \n",
    "The data was retrieved from U.S. Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) EarthExplorer [1] website. <br />\n",
    "USGS stores data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which maps the earth's land surface topology with the aforementioned resolution. <br />\n",
    "This project will use SRTM data taken from the EarthExplorer website as the foundation of the terrain parametrization. The specific terrain data we will use in the present project is taken from the Mosvatn Austfjell area in the municipality of Tinn in Telemark county, Norway. A visual representation of the data is shown in Fig. 1. <br />\n",

    "#### Franke's Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Franke function](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a081688.pdf) was originally developed to test and rate different surface interpolation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Franke function, which is a weighted sum of four exponentials reads as follows: <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f(x,y) &= \\frac{3}{4}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x-2)^2}{4} - \\frac{(9y-2)^2}{4}\\right)}+\\frac{3}{4}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x+1)^2}{49}- \\frac{(9y+1)}{10}\\right)} \\\\\n",
    "&+\\frac{1}{2}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x-7)^2}{4} - \\frac{(9y-3)^2}{4}\\right)} -\\frac{1}{5}\\exp{\\left(-(9x-4)^2 - (9y-7)^2\\right) }.\n",

    "If we go with 1.) we would need more time since every payment will be recorded and we would get more data based upon time. Another way to artifically generate more data would be by intelligently use other methods to renrich the feature space of our data. So instead of having 25 features we could augment it to 30 with additional features such as *usual shopping district*, *usual time of payments*, etc. \n",
